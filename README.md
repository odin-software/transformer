# Transformer

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/da59b148-442b-4863-a802-10b2407eed0f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/odin-transformer/deploys)

Transformer is a web app designed to handle a group of image manipulation processes. For example, converting PNG files into WebP.
It started as a little project in order to learn drag and drop and image convertion. This features are done and I will continue to add some more as I get to need them in the future.

This project was created with [Remix](https://remix.run) and it's deployed to Netlify.

I have created a blog post talking about it [here](https://kengru.do/posts/transformer-part-one).

## Get the project running

Install dependencies with yarn or npm:

`yarn install`

Create a `.env` file with the variables on the `.env.example` file.

and it should run as easy as:

`yarn dev`
